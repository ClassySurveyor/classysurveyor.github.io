IMO assembly resolution 741(18) adopted the International Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention on 4 November 1993 - otherwise known as the International Safety Management (ISM) code.  Ever since, it has served as the cornerstone of the maritime regulatory world, ensuring safety of life, environment and property.

The official objectives of the code are:
>1. test 1
>2. test 2
>
>Reference: ISM Code Pt.A Reg.1

In short, it was designed to push companies to proactively establish and implement policies aimed to protect life, environment and property and to, in a way, establish a system by which companies can be held responsible for their failures in this regard.

The code *may* be applied to all ships, but SOLAS Ch.IX (applicable from 1998-07-01) makes it applicable to the following: 
>1. Passenger ships including passenger high speed craft, not later than 1 July 1998;
>2. Oil tankers, chemical tankers, gas carriers, bulk carriers and cargo high speed craft of 500 gross tonnage and upwards, not later than 1 July 1998; and
>3. Other cargo ships and mobile offshore drilling units of 500 gross tonnage and upwards, not later than 1 July 2002.
>
>Reference: *SOLAS Ch.IX Reg.2*

The implementation of the regulation is enforced by the shipping company's Safety and Protection Policy:
>2.1    The Company should establish a safety and environmental protection policy which describes how the objectives, given in paragraph 1.2, will be achieved.
>2.2    The Company should ensure that the policy is implemented and maintained at all levels of the organization both ship based as well as shore based.
