IMO assembly resolution 741(18) adopted the International Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention on 4 November 1993 - otherwise known as the International Safety Management (ISM) code.  Ever since, it has served as the cornerstone of the maritime regulatory world, ensuring safety of life, environment and property.

The code *may* be applied to all ships, but SOLAS Ch.IX Reg.2 makes it applicable to the following: 
>1. Passenger ships including passenger high speed craft, not later than 1 July 1998;
2. Oil tankers, chemical tankers, gas carriers, bulk carriers and cargo high speed craft of 500 gross tonnage and upwards, not later than 1 July 1998; and
3. Other cargo ships and mobile offshore drilling units of 500 gross tonnage and upwards, not later than 1 July 2002.
