The 30th session of the IMO Assembly met in London at the IMO Headquarters from 27 November to 8 December 2017 and harmonized requirements for escape route signs and equipment location markings were adopted by the Assembly.

Based on the new resolution, the safety signs on board ship are now governed by ISO standard 24409-2:2014, â€œDesign, location and use of shipboard safety signs, safety related signs, safety notices and safety markings.

The requirements will apply to ships constructed on or after 1 January 2019, or amended according to SOLAS Chapter II-2 and/or Ch III after that date.
