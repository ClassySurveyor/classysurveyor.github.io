Everyone knows sailors like to tell stories.  Often they are dimissed as boastful, exaggerated tales of adventures that never took place - or at least not in the way they are told.  However, some of these stories are also part of the ancient tradition to pass on valuable knowledge and experience to the next generation.

In this blog, I will not be telling stories, let alone those of a sailor.  After all, I am not a sailor.  Instead, I will be sharing my experience, resources and thoughts on a variety of topics related to ship design, construction, management, repair, regulations and more.  I have over 20 years of experience in the industry, starting as an apprentice in shipyards, working my way up to management.  I then moved onto working as a Classification Society surveyor (thus the nickname) and, finally, ended in ship management.  Along the way, in parallel with my day jobs, I was involved in multiple temporary jobs and business ventures - all in different parts of the maritime and offshore industries.

As I was growing in this industry, I would often try to find answers to my questions online like everyone else in other industries.  However, unlike them, my searches often turned out empty or with irrelevant results.  Although shipping accounts for 90% of global trade, it is often invisible to the rest of the world.
