One of the most difficult hieroglyphics to interpret on drawings has to be the welding symbols.  I'm sure it's easy for all the engineers out there who are specialized and draw them everyday, but for the person on site, it can be challenging.  I struggled with these for many years and usually ended up relying on (mobile) internet and some reference cards for guidance - it was quite difficult to just keep it memorized.  In this post I will discuss welding symbols, how their used and how to interpret them.

## Basic Concepts
The most elementary components of the welding symbol are the arrow, the reference line and the tail.  The arrow is a bit of obvious: it points at the welded joint that the welding symbol is describing.  The reference line is sort of the "canvas" on which all the additional markings are added - it should **always** be horizontal.  The tail is used to indicate the welding or cutting processes and other additional information to be used in making the weld.  However, if there are no special instructions/requirements, it is omitted.

The arrow of the welding symbol can point in any direction, so you can position the rest of the welding symbol wherever it is convenient for the drawing, as long as the arrow points clearly to the weld joint.  However, it is important to note that the rest of the symbol **shall not be affected by the orientation of the arrow**.  This is particulary important for the next part: arrow side/other side.

For most welds, there will be two side of the joint - the arrow side and the other side.  Any information relating to the arrow side is always *below* the reference line.  Information relating to the other side is always *above* the reference line.  To me, this was always very counterintuitive so it was difficult to remember so it took a lot of practice.

What led to a lot of confusion for me in the past is that it is easy to forget that the reference line is made of two parts - the arrow side and the other side.  What I mean is that the reference line, which has no thickness, represents the divide between the welds on each side of the plate - which has a thickness.  It is a very simple concept but understanding and appreciating it goes a long way.  This becomes particularly important when you start combining groove symbols.

A circle at the connection corner of the arrow and the reference line denotes that the weld shall be continued "all around" the joint.  This **does not** mean that the weld is the same on both sides, it means you carry out the weld (as defined by the rest of the weld symbol) all around the circumference of the pipe, or the perimeter of the square section, for example.

A flag at the connection corner of the arrow and the reference line denotes that the weld is a "field weld" - it shall be carried out on site.  If there is no flag, then it should be either carried out in the shop or it doesn't matter.  This is mostly important when some part is manufactured in a workshop and then installed on site with welds.  In this example, all the parts that are assembled in the workshop will have weld symbols without a flag and the welds to the foundation on site will have a flag symbol, for example.

Now we have the more intuitive part (at least for me) - the weld types.  The basic categorisation of welds are fillet welds, butt welds, flare welds, plug/slot welds and edge welds.  These further break down to more specific categories and so I will present the next part in sections.

## Fillet welds
Most often seen in T joints and corners, these welds are identified with the triangular cross-section of the weld seam.  Thus, the symbol for a fillet weld is a right-angle triangle.  Depending on the location of the triangle, we can now read where the fillet weld is placed - arrow side, the other side or both sides.

As noted before, it is crucial to understand that the reference line is made of two parts - the arrow side and the other side.  So although the two fillet signs are touching in the weld symbol, this has nothing to do with what you'll see on site so each triangle, or any symbol, on different sides of the reference line should be interpretted separately.  I understand this might be very obvious for some but to me, this realization was an eye-opener back in the day.
