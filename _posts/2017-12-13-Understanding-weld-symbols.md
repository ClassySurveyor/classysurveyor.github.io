One of the most difficult hieroglyphics to interpret on drawings has to be the welding symbols.  I'm sure it's easy for all the engineers out there who are specialized and draw them everyday, but for the person on site, it can be challenging.  I struggled with these for many years and usually ended up relying on (mobile) internet and some reference cards for guidance - it was quite difficult to just keep it memorized.  In this post I will discuss welding symbols, how their used and how to interpret them.

The most elementary components of the welding symbol are the arrow, the reference line and the tail.  The arrow is a bit of obvious: it points at the welded joint that the welding symbol is describing.  The reference line is sort of the "canvas" on which all the additional markings are added - it should **always** be horizontal.  The tail is used to indicate the welding or cutting processes and other additional information to be used in making the weld.
