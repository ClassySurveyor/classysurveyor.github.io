	<h3 class="title">Understanding welding symbols</h3>
	<h5 class="date" style="margin-bottom:30px;">23 December 2017</h5>


<p>One of the most difficult hieroglyphics to interpret on drawings has to be the welding symbols.  I’m sure it’s easy for all the engineers out there who are specialized and draw them everyday, but for the person on site, it can be challenging.  I struggled with these for many years and usually ended up relying on (mobile) internet and some reference cards for guidance - it was quite difficult to just keep it memorized.  In this post I will discuss welding symbols, how their used and how to interpret them.</p>

<h2 id="basic-concepts">Basic Concepts</h2>
<p>The most elementary components of the welding symbol are the arrow, the reference line and the tail.  The arrow is a bit of obvious: it points at the welded joint that the welding symbol is describing.  The reference line is sort of the “canvas” on which all the additional markings are added - it should <strong>always</strong> be horizontal.  The tail is used to indicate the welding or cutting processes and other additional information to be used in making the weld.  However, if there are no special instructions/requirements, it is omitted.</p>

<p>The arrow of the welding symbol can point in any direction, so you can position the rest of the welding symbol wherever it is convenient for the drawing, as long as the arrow points clearly to the weld joint.  It can be on the right of the reference line or on the left side.  However, it is important to note that the rest of the symbol <strong>shall not be affected by the orientation of the arrow</strong>.  This is particulary important for the next part: arrow side/other side.</p>

<p>For most welds, there will be two side of the joint - the arrow side and the other side.  Any information relating to the arrow side is always <em>below</em> the reference line.  Information relating to the other side is always <em>above</em> the reference line.  To me, this was always very counterintuitive so it was difficult to remember so it took a lot of practice.</p>

<p>What led to a lot of confusion for me in the past is that it is easy to forget that the reference line is made of two parts - the arrow side and the other side.  What I mean is that the reference line, which has no thickness, represents the divide between the welds on each side of the plate - which has a thickness.  It is a very simple concept but understanding and appreciating it goes a long way.  This becomes particularly important when you start combining groove symbols.</p>

<p>A circle at the connection corner of the arrow and the reference line denotes that the weld shall be continued “all around” the joint.  This <strong>does not</strong> mean that the weld is the same on both sides, it means you carry out the weld (as defined by the rest of the weld symbol) all around the circumference of the pipe, or the perimeter of the square section, for example.</p>

<p>A flag at the connection corner of the arrow and the reference line denotes that the weld is a “field weld” - it shall be carried out on site.  If there is no flag, then it should be either carried out in the shop or it doesn’t matter.  This is mostly important when some part is manufactured in a workshop and then installed on site with welds.  In this example, all the parts that are assembled in the workshop will have weld symbols without a flag and the welds to the foundation on site will have a flag symbol, for example.</p>

<p>Now we have the more intuitive part (at least for me) - the weld types.  The basic categorisation of welds are fillet welds, butt welds, flare welds, plug/slot welds and edge welds.  These further break down to more specific categories and so I will present the next part in sections.</p>

<h2 id="fillet-welds">Fillet welds</h2>
<p>Most often seen in T joints and corners, these welds are identified with the triangular cross-section of the weld seam.  Thus, the symbol for a fillet weld is a right-angle triangle.  Depending on the location of the triangle, we can now read where the fillet weld is placed - arrow side, the other side or both sides.</p>

<p>As noted before, it is crucial to understand that the reference line is made of two parts - the arrow side and the other side.  So although the two fillet signs are touching in the weld symbol, this has nothing to do with what you’ll see on site so each triangle, or any symbol, on different sides of the reference line should be interpretted separately.  I understand this might be very obvious for some but to me, this realization was an eye-opener back in the day.</p>

<p>The triangle shall <strong>always</strong> have the perpendicular leg on the left side.  In other words, if you imagine the triangle to be an arrow, the arrow shall <strong>always</strong> point right - regardless of the weld orientation or location.  With the perpendicular side always on the left, the leg size is written to the left of the weld symbol, next to the perpendicular side of the triangle.  If it’s a single value, then both legs of the fillet weld are equal.  If there are two numbers separated by an “x”, then the first value is the horizontal leg, the second value is the vertical leg.</p>

<p>It is very important to write the fillet leg sizes on the <strong>left</strong> of the triangle because the length of the weld, if relevant, is written on the right side.  If there is no length given, then it is assumed that the weld is continued along the joint until there is some obvious break (a sudden turn, a hole, a different plate, etc.)  If the length on the right of the triangle is followed by a hyphen and a value (e.g. “2-4”), then this is an indication of the spacing of intermittent welds.  So the first value after the triangle is the length, as before, and the value after the hyphen is the distance between the starting point of two consecutive welds (also known as the pitch).</p>

<h2 id="butt-welds">Butt welds</h2>
<p>Butt welds in itself do not have their own symbol but are denoted by a whole range of symbols which in fact refer to the groove.</p>

<h3 id="square-groove-welds">Square groove welds</h3>
<p>This is the simplest groove weld which is just made of square edges.  The symbol is equally simple with two parallel lines.  What’s unusual about this symbol is that the lines almost always cross the reference line.  This is because a square groove butt weld is usually the same on both sides.  The gap between the plates is written in between the parallel lines, above the reference line.</p>
