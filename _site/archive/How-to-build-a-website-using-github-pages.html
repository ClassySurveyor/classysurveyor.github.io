	<h5 class="date" style="margin-bottom:30px;"></h5>


<p>GitHub Pages, Jekyll and a whole slew of other resource centers have posted all kinds of tutorials on this matter but, so far, I have found them to be insufficient.  I appreciate that GitHub and Jekyll users generally tend to be more computer-savvy than most and, thus, the tutorials tend to be aimed at those kinds of audiences, I managed to stumble accross GitHub Pages myself and found that I did not quite understand the tutorials.</p>

<p>With this tutorial, I will walk step-by-step on how to create a simple, one-page website for minimal cost, from absolute scratch - concept to publishing.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer: It is assumed that you have basic html experience as I won’t dwell into how to actually write up the website’s code, but rather focus on design, approach and systematics.</strong></p>

<h1 id="conceptualising">Conceptualising</h1>
<p>If you have reached this post, you probably already have some idea for a website that you wish to realise.  Being a basic tutorial, I will focus on building a sample basic, one-page website for an imaginary poster/art printing company called “Mulhouse Art Prints”.</p>

<h2 id="a-little-about-one-page-websites">A little about one-page websites</h2>
<p>Gone are the days that people had the attention span or the care to go around clicking links on websites.  It has been a general trend in web design to move towards simpler layouts that require the least amount of user actions to reach the content.  At the same time, a website has become an essential element for any business nowadays.</p>

<p>As such, one-page websites have been the most logical solution to providing simple, straightforward welcoming pages for businesses that don’t operate online, but rather use the website as a place to display contact information, their capabilities and other necessary information.</p>

<p>If done right, a one-page website may look much more “rich” than any other website structure and give off an aura of professionalism, creativity, and value which may be lost in more complex structures.  Additionally, it will take less time to build and even less time to maintain.</p>

<p>You can see an extensive gallery of all kinds of really creative one-page websites on <a href="https://onepagelove.com/">One Page Love</a>.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-your-purpose">Understanding your purpose</h2>
<p>What has helped me in building websites in the past is to first truly understand your business/idea/website and to write down exactly what you want to share with the viewers of your website.</p>

<p>To start off, first write exactly what you are.  In the case of Mulhouse Art Prints:<br />
<em>We are a print house that designs, prints and frames high-quality art prints and drawings.</em></p>

<p>Then, list down exactly what you want the user to know/feel after viewing your website.  In the case of Mulhouse Art Prints:<br />
<em>We want the viewers to know about our capabilities (designing, printing, framing, reproducing)</em></p>

<p><em>We want the viewers to be assured of our workmanship (printing resolutions, paper types, warranty, return policy, awards, our track record (past jobs and customers))</em></p>

<p><em>We want the viewers to contact us for more information/make orders.</em></p>

<p>With your purpose in mind, you can now start assigning sections and elements to your website that will achieve the above.  However, in doing so, it is worth looking around other one-page websites to understand what are some common elements/design cues that you may use to display the necessary information.</p>

<h2 id="designing-sections">Designing sections</h2>
<p>First off, we’ll have the top section of the website dedicated to branding in the form of a company logo, name, motto or the alike.  Just something simple to attract attention and to make the viewer fully aware where they have landed.</p>

<p>The next section, we can use to introduce the fact that <em>we are a print house that designs, prints and frames high-quality art prints and drawings.</em>  This can be achieved using graphics or text.  Let’s assume a simple, short, paragraph for this example.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We are a print house in Stockholm that delivers high-quality art prints for the interior decor of your home and office.  We create a wide variety of original prints as well as reproductions that suit the needs of all customers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s not a very articulate introductory paragraph, but length-wise, you should not exceed this, I think.  It should be a straightforward <em>basic</em> introduction - details will be included in the next sections.</p>

<p>Often times, one-page websites have a section with 2-4 icons followed by a small bit of text which is usually used to list concepts/services/capabilities.  Having introduced the basic concept of the company, we can next have such a section where we present the capabilities of Mulhouse Art Prints: design, printing, framing and reproducing high-quality art-prints.  For each of these, we will need some graphics and a small bit of text.</p>

<p><a href="https://thenounproject.com/">The Noun Project</a> is a <em>fantastic</em> source of all sorts of icons and graphics.  However, you may choose to get your graphics from wherever your wish.  It is my <strong>strong</strong> suggestion that you stick to vector graphics rather than photos, unless your business has a specific needs for photos.  The simple reason is that vector graphics convey concepts better and they visually scale better for different window sizes.</p>

<p>These are the four graphics that I chose for this section.</p>

<p>It’s good practice to make sure that the graphics are of similar size.  Try to stick to .svg files but .png is equally okay.</p>

<p>So now we have a full-width section, followed by a four-column section so now we should have something with two or less columns - it generally looks better when you have this system of alternating numbers of columns.</p>

<h2 id="boilerplates">Boilerplates</h2>
<p>Of course everyone can design a website from scratch to fit their heart’s liking but for most users, I would recommend using a “boilerplate” to get started.  A boilerplate is</p>
