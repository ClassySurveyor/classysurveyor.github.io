The 30th session of the IMO Assembly met in London at the IMO Headquarters from 27 November to 8 December 2017 and harmonized requirements for escape route signs and equipment location markings were adopted by the Assembly.  Based on the new resolution, the safety signs on board ship are now governed by ISO standard 24409-2:2014, “Design, location and use of shipboard safety signs, safety related signs, safety notices and safety markings." The requirements will apply to ships constructed on or after 1 January 2019, or amended according to SOLAS Ch. II-2 and/or Ch. III after that date.

This marks another move in the general direction of linking international standards and IMO regulations, in order to reduce repetition and make it easier to keep standards and regulations up-to-date harmoniously.

Previously, the IMO signs that were posted around the ship were posted due to various references in SOLAS Ch. II-2 and/or Ch. III and the signs themselves were given in [Resolution A.760(18) Symbols Related to Life-Saving Appliance and Arrangements](http://www.imo.org/blast/blastDataHelper.asp?data_id=22605&filename=A760(18)E.pdf), which was amended by [Resolution MSC.82(70)](http://www.imo.org/en/KnowledgeCentre/IndexofIMOResolutions/Maritime-Safety-Committee-(MSC)/Documents/MSC.82(70).pdf).  However, in 2002, the Maritime Safety Committee noted that ISO was developing a new ISO standard for shipboard signage and agreed that, once the standard was published, it may replace resolution A.760(18), as amended by resolution MSC.82(70) - [Ref. MSC Circular 1553](http://www.classysurveyor.com/assets/IMO/MSC.1-Circ.1553%20-%20Shipboard%20Escape%20Route%20Signs%20And%20Emergency%20Equipment%20Location%20Markings%20(Secretariat).pdf).

Now, SOLAS Ch. II-2 and Ch. III will simply refer to ISO 24409-2:2014 and any updates to the ISO standard will propagate to the SOLAS requirements.

## Summary of Changes
ISO 24409-2:2014 takes on a **much** more detailed approach to these signboards - as they usually do with everything else.  Every signboard is categorized, given a reference number, name, function, image description, the hazard that it mitigates, intended human behaviour, additional information, complementary signs and further references.  I must say, the standardization is refreshing for an obsessive-compulsive like myself.

Also, some signs have been updated and some have been reused.

## Commentary

Although this makes the job of the regulators easier, it makes the job of the enforcers and applicants more difficult.  It is sufficiently difficult to have access to one set of regulatory instruments but when you start referring to other standards, it forces users to obtain access to those references too - this can be impractical and costly.

If we do a direct comparison, in this case, all one needed was the SOLAS publication - available from IMO in electronic format for £90 - and the freely available circulars.  Now, one must also purchase ISO 24409-2:2014 - availaable from ISO for CHF 198 (approximately £150).  This leads to an overall cost 2.5 times greater than before (£90 vs £240).

Of course most companies have corporate access to all the necessary documents but there are two issues for me:
1. The smaller organisations within this industry face difficulty justifying such expenses, leading to non-compliance which could lead to less safe operations.
2. The interested student/person's access to valuable information is limited as is and increasing costs make it more difficult to obtain information.

Other than access, it is quite tedious for me to read regulations and then have to click away to multiple other references just to understand the most basic things.

All the above further justifies the value in my consolidated, free summaries of such things for general consumption.
