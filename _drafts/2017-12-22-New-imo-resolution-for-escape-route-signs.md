The 30th session of the IMO Assembly met in London at the IMO Headquarters from 27 November to 8 December 2017 and harmonized requirements for escape route signs and equipment location markings were adopted by the Assembly.  Based on the new resolution, the safety signs on board ship are now governed by ISO standard 24409-2:2014, â€œDesign, location and use of shipboard safety signs, safety related signs, safety notices and safety markings." The requirements will apply to ships constructed on or after 1 January 2019, or amended according to SOLAS Ch. II-2 and/or Ch. III after that date.

This marks another move in the general direction of linking international standards and IMO regulations, in order to reduce repetition and make it easier to keep standards and regulations up-to-date harmoniously.

Previously, the IMO signs that were posted around the ship were posted due to ***REFERENCE HERE*** and the signs themselves were given in ***REFERENCE HERE***.  Now, SOLAS Ch. II-2 and Ch. III will simply refer to ISO 24409-2:2014 and any updates to the ISO standard will propagate to the SOLAS requirements.

Although this makes the job of the regulators easier, it makes the job of the enforcers and applicants more difficult.  It is sufficiently difficult to have access to one set of regulatory instruments but when you start referring to other standards, it forces users to obtain access to those references too - this can be impractical and costly.  Specifically speaking, IMO regulations are all freely available.  ISO standards are *not*.

As a class surveyor, I always have people in the industry asking me to help them get clarification on an ISO standard because it is not worth it for them to purchase a standard for 70-odd dollars/euro for just one sentence - and I don't blame them.
