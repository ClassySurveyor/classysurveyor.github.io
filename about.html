	<h3 class="title">About</h3>
	<p>I am a <a href="https://www.wartsila.com/encyclopedia/term/class-surveyor">class surveyor</a> for a <a href="https://www.wartsila.com/encyclopedia/term/classification-societies">classification society</a> working with new-building projects and in-service ships and offshore units.  I also carry out surveys for certification of materials and components as well as other third-party verification services.</p>
	<p>The purpose of this blog is to share some of the experiences and the knowledge that I am exposed to.  For now I am starting it off as simply a blog and we shall see where it goes as time passes.</p>
	<p>Thanks for visiting and I hope you enjoy the materials!</p>
